    ">  These predictions are based __solely on the instantaneous physical characteristics of the acousticalsignal and do not make use of its history__. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal emitted from thefault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables failure forecasting throughout thelaboratory quake cycle. We infer that this signal originates from continuous grain motions of the fault gougeas the fault blocks displace.\n",
